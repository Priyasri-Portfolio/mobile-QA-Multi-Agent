# mobile-QA-Multi-Agent
QualGent Research Intern Coding Challenge
This project is my solution to the QualGent Mobile QA Multi‑Agent Challenge. It uses a Supervisor–Planner–Executor agent system to run natural‑language QA tests on the Obsidian Android app. The agents plan actions, execute ADB commands on a real device, and report whether each test passes or fails. I chose Google’s Agent Development Kit (ADK) for its clean multi‑agent structure and easy tool integration. The repository includes the Part 2 decision memo, the test cases, and the code for running the automated tests.
